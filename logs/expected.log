SPECIAL 'DECK OF CARDS' USED. THERE ARE NO FACE CARDS - ONLY

NUMBER BETWEEN 0 AND 200.  I THEN PICK A RANDOM NUMBER

BECAUSE OF THE RARE CHANCE OF YOU GETTING TO THAT NUMBER
EXACTLY, YOU ARE GIVEN AN ALLOWANCE CARD.  THE OBJECT OF
THE GAME OF TO GET THE TOTAL OF CARDS WITHIN THE MYSTERY
NUMBER WITHOUT GOING OVER.
YOU ARE GIVEN A HINT AS TO WHAT THE NUMBER IS.  THIS IS NOT
THE EXACT NUMBER ONLY ONE CLOSE. ALL YOU DO IN THIS GAME IS

WITH THE NUMBER AND YOUR WINNINGS ARE DETERMINED.
